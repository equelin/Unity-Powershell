Function  Get-UnityServiceAction {

  <#
      .SYNOPSIS
      Information about storage system service actions. <br/> <br/> Collect Service Information (dataCollection): Collect information about the storage system and save it to a file. Your service provider can use the collected information to analyze the storage system. <br/> <br/> Save Configuration (configCapture): Save details about the configuration settings on the storage system to a file. Your service provider can use this file to assist you with reconfiguring your system after a major system failure or a system reinitialization. <br/> <br/> Restart Management Software (restartMGT): Restart the management software to resolve connection problems between the system and Unisphere. <br/> <br/> Reinitialize (reinitialize): Reset the storage system to the original factory settings. Both SPs must be installed and operating normally be in Service Mode. <br/> <br/> Change Service Password (changeServicePassword): Change the service password for accessing the Service System page. <br/> <br/> Shut Down System (shutdownSystem): The system shut down and power cycle procedures will attempt to resolve problems with your storage system that could not be resolved by rebooting or reimaging the SP. <br/> <br/> Disable SSH/Enable SSH (changeSSHStatus): Disable the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol to block SSH access to the system, or enable the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol to enable access to the system. <br/> <br/> Enter Service Mode (enterServiceModeSPA, enterServiceModeSPB): Stop I/O on the SP so that the SP can enter service mode safely. <br/> <br/> Reboot (rebootSPA, rebootSPB): Reboot the selected SP. Use this service action to attempt to resolve minor problems related to system software or SP hardware components. <br/> <br/> Reimage (rebootSPA, rebootSPB): Reimage the selected SP. Reimaging analyzes the system software on the SP and attempts to correct any problems automatically. <br/> <br/> Reset and Hold(resetAndHoldSPA, resetAndHoldSPB): Reset and hold the selected SP. Use this service task to attempt to reset and hold the SP, so that users can replace the faulty IoModule(s) on that SP. <br/> <br/>
