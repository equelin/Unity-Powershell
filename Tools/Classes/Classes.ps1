  Name: UnitydnsServer
  Description: Domain Name System (DNS) settings. <p/> A Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical system responsible for converting domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. The system uses DNS services to resolve network names and IP addresses for the network services it needs (for example, for NTP and SMTP servers), and to obtain IP addresses for hosts addressed by network names rather than IP addresses. <p/> During the initial system configuration process you must specify the network address of at least one DNS server for resolving hostnames to IP addresses. Later, you can add, delete, or change DNS server settings. <p/> You can configure multiple DNS server domains to specify each domain and IP address of the DNS servers for the system to use. By default, the system uses the top entry in the list as the current DNS server. The remaining list provides a hierarchy of DNS servers to use if the first-choice server becomes unavailable. If the first DNS server in the list becomes unavailable, the system proceeds to the next DNS server in the list, and so on. You can also specify default DNS server addresses to indicate which addresses the system will use first. <p/> DNS server addresses are grouped under DNS server domains. Each domain is identified by a domain identifier. <p/> <b>Important:</b> You must configure at least one valid DNS server entry in the domain for the system. Deleting the last DNS server entry can disrupt network communication to the device, and potentially interrupt communication between the system and the hosts that use its storage resources.

  Name: UnityfileEventsPublisher
  Description: File Event Service is a mechanism whereby applications can register to receive event notification and context from sources such as VNX(e). File Event Service is a part of VNX Event Enabler Framework (VEE). VEE provides the working environment for the CAVA and CEPA (Common Event Publishing Agent) facilities. The event publishing agent delivers to the application both event notification and associated context in one message. Context may consist of file metadata or directory metadata needed to decide business policy. The CEPA sub-facilities include: - Auditing.A mechanism for delivering post-events to registered consumer applications in a synchronous manner. Events are delivered individually in real-time. - CQM.A mechanism for delivering pre-events to registered consumer applications in a synchronous manner. Events are delivered individually in real-time, allowing the consumer application to exercise business policy on the event. - VCAPS.A mechanism for delivering post-events in asynchronous mode. The delivery cadence is based on a time period or a number of events. - MessageExchange.A mechanism for delivering post-events in asynchronous mode, when needed, without consumer use of the CEPA API. Events are published from CEPA to the RabbitMQ CEE_Events exchange. A consumer application creates a queue for itself in the exchange from which it can retrieve events. <br/> <br/>

  Description: The NDMP server for the NAS Server. You can configure one NDMP server per NAS server. <br/> The Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) provides a standard for backing up file servers on a network. NDMP allows centralized applications to back up file servers that run on various platforms and platform versions. NDMP reduces network congestion by isolating control path traffic from data path traffic, which permits centrally managed and monitored local backup operations. Storage systems support NDMP v2-v4 over the network. Direct-attach NDMP is not supported. This means that the tape drives need to be connected to a media server, and the NAS server communicates with the media server over the network. NDMP has an advantage when using multiprotocol file systems because it backs up the Windows ACLs as well as the UNIX security information.

The new local LUN migration feature address this concern, by adding the ability to move LUNs and Consistency Groups between Pools on a system. Local LUN migration can be used to rebalance storage resources across Pools when customer activity changes and an individual Pool's usage becomes oversaturated. Another use case for local LUN migration is to provide LUNs with a destination when a Pool is to be decommissioned. By leveraging Unity's Transparent Data Transfer (TDX) engine, host access remains fully online during the migration session.

  Name: UnitynasServer
  Description: Information about the NAS server in the storage system. <br/> <br/> NAS Servers are software components used to transfer data and provide the connection ports for hosts to access file-level storage resources. NAS servers are independent from each other. <br/> <br/> NAS Servers access data on available drives making it available to network hosts via specific protocols (NFS/SMB/FTP/SFTP). Storage system supports NAS Servers for managing file-level storage resources, such as VMware NFS datastores or file systems. <br/> Before you can provision a file-level storage resource, a NAS Server must be created with the necessary sharing protocols enabled. When NAS Servers are created, you can specify the storage pool and owning SP - either SPA or SPB. <br/> In the storage systems, NAS Servers can leverage the Link Aggregation functionality to create a highly available environment. Once a link aggregated port group is available, you create or modify NAS Server network interfaces to leverage the available port group. Because NAS Servers are accessible through only one SP at a time, they will fail over to the other SP when there is an SP failure event.

  Name: UnitypreferredInterfaceSettings
  Description: The preferred interface of NAS server is an interface from which all the non-local outbound connections of this NAS server are initiated. The non-local connections are those which hosts can be accessed from this NAS server interfaces only via some router (gateway). <p/> The preferred interfaces for IPv4 and IPv6 are independent from each other. During the replication, the production interfaces could be activated and deactivated automatically, so the separate preferred interface settings are required for production and backup & DR testing interfaces. For each NAS server, the following preferred interface settings exist: <ol> <li>Production interfaces, IPv4.</li> <li>Production interfaces, IPv6.</li> <li>Backup & DR testing interfaces, IPv4.</li> <li>Backup & DR testing interfaces, IPv6.</li> </ol> <p/> Each of these settings could be set to the explicit interface. If it isn't set, corresponding interface will be selected automatically. <p/> The acting preferred interfaces, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6, are selected among active interfaces by the following rules, ordered by priority (highest first): <ol> <li>Manually selected interfaces have priority over automatically selected ones.</li> <li>Production interfaces have priority over backup and DR testing ones.</li> <li>The interface with the default gateway has priority over one not having one.</li> <li>From the otherwise equal priority interfaces, one with the most routes has the priority.</li> <li>From the otherwise equal priority interfaces, one with the minimal value of IP address (Sic!) has the priority.</li> </ol> <p/> <b>Note: </b>During the replication, on the destination side, only Backup & DR testing interfaces could be active. <p/> For the automatic selection, the interface re-selected each time any of this NAS interfaces or routes are changed. If the interface has been explicitly selected as preferred and then deleted, this type/class group setting (e.g. "Production/IPv6") gets reset to automatic selection. <p/> During the replication, on the destination side, only the production interfaces settings could be overridden. It is controlled by the single flag both for IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces. Note that this flag is independent from the "override" flag of the interface itself. If an interface is explicitly selected as preferred and then overridden, the interface is kept preferred. <p/> The acting preferred interfaces are marked by the corresponding property value, fileInterface.isPreferred == true. To get the list of the acting preferred interfaces of a NAS server, iterate its interface list checking the isPreferred property.

  Description: All the system level security settings. <br/> Use this resource to enable and disable system level security settings. <br/> The settings include: <br/> <br/> a) FIPS 140-2 <br/> Information about whether the system is working in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 mode. <br/> <br/> The storage systems support FIPS 140-2 mode for the RSA BSAFE SSL modules on the storage pocessor that handle client management traffic. Management communication into and out of the system is encrypted using SSL. As a part of this process, the client and the Storage Management Server negotiate a cipher suite to use in the exchange. The use of FIPS 140-2 mode restricts the allowable set of cipher suites that can be selected in the negotiation to those that are sufficiently strong. <br/> <br/> If FIPS 140-2 mode is enabled, you may find that some of your existing clients can no longer communicate with the management ports of the array if they do not support a cipher suite of acceptable strength. <br/> <br/> b) SSO <br/> Information about whether the system is participating in Single Sign On mode. <br/> <br/> In Single Sign On (SSO) mode, Unisphere Central (UC) becomes the authentication server for multiple storage system, thus creating a shared authentication domain where cross-array operations can be performed without re-entering user credentials. <br/> <br/> If SSO is enabled, the system will participate in Single Sign On mode, and authenticate against Unisphere Central previously configured on this array. <br/> <br/> c) TLS 1.0 <br/> Information about whether the Storage Management Server allows SSL communication using the TLS 1.0 protocol. <br/> <br/> Management communication into and out of the Storage Management Server is encrypted using SSL. As a part of this process, the client and the Storage Management Server negotiate a SSL protocol to use. By default, the Storage Management Server supports TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 protocols for SSL communications. Disabling the TLS 1.0 protocol using this setting means that the Storage Management Server will only support SSL communications using the TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 protocols and TLS 1.0 will not be considered a valid protocol. <br/> <br/> Disabling TLS 1.0 may impact existing client applications which are not compatible with TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2 protocols. In this case, TLS 1.0 support should remain enabled. <br/> <br/>

  Name: Unitytenant
  Description: A tenant is a representation of a datacenter client, who uses an independent network structure and gets the independent and exclusive access to certain storage resources. On the storage array, it corresponds to a NAS server group with an independent IP addressing. At the moment, iSCSI and management resources do not support multi-tenant access. For each tenant a corresponding Linux network namespace is created. In the current design, traffic separation between the tenants is done by the VLANs. Each tenant reserves a group of VLANs, and each VLAN can belong to one tenant maximum. Every tenant gets a name and the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). The UUID cannot be changed during the tenant life cycle. The asynchronous replication of the NAS servers is allowed only between the servers belonging to the tenants with the same UUID. The NAS servers and VLANs can still belong to no tenant. Such NAS servers and VLANs operate in the Linux base network namespace, together with management and iSCSI interfaces. The control stack of the system does not allow user to log in in the tenant administrator role. All the tenants, NAS servers and VLANs are managed from the single system administrator account. To allow this, the corresponding GUI and CLI modifications are made.

If the file is infected, corrective action (fixed, removed or placed in quarantine) is taken as defined by the anti-virus server. You can optionally set up the service to scan the file on read access based on last access of the file compared to last update of the third-party anti-virus date. <br/> A virusChecker object is created each time the anti-virus service is enabled on a NAS server. A configuration file (named viruschecker.conf) needs to be uploaded on the NAS server before enabling the anti-virus service.
