<#
  Name: UnitynasServer
  Description: Information about the NAS server in the storage system. <br/> <br/> NAS Servers are software components used to transfer data and provide the connection ports for hosts to access file-level storage resources. NAS servers are independent from each other. <br/> <br/> NAS Servers access data on available drives making it available to network hosts via specific protocols (NFS/SMB/FTP/SFTP). Storage system supports NAS Servers for managing file-level storage resources, such as VMware NFS datastores or file systems. <br/> Before you can provision a file-level storage resource, a NAS Server must be created with the necessary sharing protocols enabled. When NAS Servers are created, you can specify the storage pool and owning SP - either SPA or SPB. <br/> In the storage systems, NAS Servers can leverage the Link Aggregation functionality to create a highly available environment. Once a link aggregated port group is available, you create or modify NAS Server network interfaces to leverage the available port group. Because NAS Servers are accessible through only one SP at a time, they will fail over to the other SP when there is an SP failure event.
