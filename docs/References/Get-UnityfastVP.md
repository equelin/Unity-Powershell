# Get-UnityFastVP

## SYNOPSIS
System FAST VP settings.
FAST VP allows performing automatic data relocation between tiers and rebalancing within a tier to improve storage performance.
Currently there three types of relocations supported: \<br/\> \<li\>Scheduled relocations\</li\> \<li\>Manual relocations\</li\> \<li\>Rebalancing\</li\> \<br/\> Scheduled relocations are started according the schedule defined in this resource.
Individual pools can be included to or excluded from the scheduled relocation process.
\<br/\> Manual relocations can be performed on demand for each particular pool.
\<br/\> Rebalancing is performed automatically on a pool extend event.
\<br/\> The FAST VP object represents the status of scheduled relocation processes and allows to view or modify the scheduled relocation parameters.
It also provides a means to pause or resume all the FAST VP relocation and rebalancing processes currently running on the system.
